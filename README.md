<strong> Lessons Learned</strong> 
<p>This project was my first experience working with  CSS preprocessor SASS, using scss, watching the scss file with a VS code extension.
I decided to ease into learning SASS by primarily focusing on utilizing custom variables and nesting. In future projects I look forward to learning more about Mix-ins and psuedo classes.  This project also allowed me to experiment more with positioning attributes in css, in order to place text over the sidebar image. Previously my only experience with positioning was by making modals, so this was a good introduction to other uses for positioning.

The javascript password validation is a simple validation via a strict equality comparison of the values of the two password inputs.

I had originally wanted to implement a form progress bar but was unable to find any satisfying resources to help me implement that, so I hope to do that in the future when I have more experience.
